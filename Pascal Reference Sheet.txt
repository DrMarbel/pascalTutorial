~Pascal Tutorial~

Language Vocabulary:

writeln = display string on screen and creates a second blank line *similar to C#*
write = dislay string on screen and does not create a second blank line *similar to C#*
readln = program will wait before closing
var = creates a new empty variable
: = used when declaring a new variable and it's data type
:= = set variable as/change variable status

Data Types:
*placed under VAR heading*

string = string data type
char = char data type
integer = integer data type
real = floating point data type
??? = boolean data type

Mathematical Operators:
*Pascal follows the PEMDAS order of operations*

+ = addition
- = subtraction
* = multiplication
/ = division
div = integer division
mod = remainder

<EXAMPLE>

Division:
*Pascal displays division results in scientific notation*

10/3 = 3.333333333333E+0000
*In order to fix this, look below*
10/3 = 3:0:2 = 3.33 (this method excludes a space to the far left)
10/3 = 3:5:2 =  3.33 ( this method includes a space to the far left)

Language Rules:

<end all commands with ;>
<when doing math, do not include '', ('2+3'), else it returns the operation as a string to be printed>
<variables can not begin with a number>
<when setting a string or char value for the first time, use '' and not "">
<when setting an integer or real value for the first time, do not use any quotes>
